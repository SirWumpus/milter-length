--TODO--


--0.9--

   !	Fixed possible off by one error for body chunks less than 20
   	bytes. Reported by Ben Lentz.

--0.8.22--

   !	Document correction. Removed old Usage section that no longer
   	applied. Reported by Ben Spencer.

--0.8--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.63

  !!	filterMail() neglected to reset the maxBytesRcpt between messages.
  
   !	Corrected RFC 3463 Enhanced Mail System Status Codes from 5.7.1
   	to 5.3.4.

  !!	filterBody(): Fixed obsecure bug when the message content is
	less than 20 bytes long, adding a terminating NUL to the body
	chunk for the trace log output actually overwrote off the end
	of a dynamic buffer on some Linux systems causing the milter
	to crash. Reported by Martin Lathoud.

   +	access-db now supports socket-map, flat-file, and SQLite3
	lookups in addition to Berkeley DB. The SQLite3 behaviour
	can be disabled via LibSnert's ./configure script.

--0.7--

  !!	License 1.4 which provides additional details with regards to
  	possible license controls used, the possibility of "phone
  	home code" and its general contents, and related privacy
  	statement.

   +	Add check for filterOpen() got NULL socket address pointer passed to filterOpen()
   	which inidicates an unsupported address type. The connection
   	is simply accepted to bypass the milter.

--0.6--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.61

  !!	Complete replacement of option specification and no backwards.
	compatibility. The newer format allows for better integration
	of previously undocumented libsnert options and for the
	inclusion of future enhancements.

   !	filterClose(): remove reporting of "null workspace error",
	which can occur when a client connection is rejected before or
	by filterOpen().
	
   !	Minor corrections for gcc -Wall warnings.

   !	Fixed smfAccessClient() argument bug.

--0.5.15--

  !!	Lets try this again...
  
   !	Fix rejection message which cited the wrong maxBytes variable
   	in the response. Reported by Doron Shmaryahu.


--0.5--

   !	Fix rejection message which cited the wrong maxBytes variable
   	in the response. Reported by Doron Shmaryahu.
   	
   !	Allow for both upper and lower case unit specifiers, ie: 800k
   	and 800K should be the same. Reported by Doron Shmaryahu.

   !	Reverted back to libmilter's default (7210s) timeout. This
	should silence many of the reported sendmail to milter timeout
	errors and/or broken connections caused by the milter timing
	out sooner than sendmail does with the current SMTP client.
	The sendmail defaults for each SMTP command and receiving the
	message content is 1h each and so libmilter allows for 2h 10s.
	But in theory you could be DoS for between 5 and 104 hours per
	connection. If you want to change this then set in
	sendmail.mc:
	
		define(`confTO_DATABLOCK',      `30m')
		define(`confTO_COMMAND',        `5m')
  	
--0.4--
  
   !	Fixed bug in selecting the max. message length to apply. The
   	choice is now based on the following precendence, from high
   	to low order:
  
  	  a) max. value of all relevant milter-length-to:,
  	  b) milter-length-auth:,
  	  c) milter-length-from:,
  	  d) milter-length-connect:,
  	  e) unlimited
  	  
   !	Replaced use of LIBSNERT_WITH_BERKELEY_DB by HAVE_DB_H due to
   	changes in LibSnert/1.59.

--0.3--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.57

   +	Added support for default max. message length:
   
   		milter-length-connect:		RHS
   		milter-length-from:		RHS
   		
   	Requested by Michael Long.
   	
   +	Added support for 
   
   		milter-length-auth:authid	RHS
   		milter-length-auth:		RHS
   	
   	Requested by Michael Long.

   +	Added support for 
   
   		milter-length-to:recipient	RHS
   		milter-length-to:		RHS
   
   	Requested by Sebastian Utz.

   +	Added host/IP to rejection message. Request by Michael Long.
   	
--0.2--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.56

   !	Changed install.sh.in to create /var/run/mitler/ directory
   	owned by milter:milter and change the default PID_FILE and
   	SOCKET_FILE paths. This provides better privelage/security
   	separation since the milters run as milter:milter.

--0.1--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.53
